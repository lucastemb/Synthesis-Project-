And because of the different styles that basketball allows for, players develop their own distinct identities and signature styles through their creativity, flair, and athleticism. Although no player succeeds alone, the scoring volume and two-way nature of the sport give individual stars a nearly unprecedented amount of control over the flow and outcome of the game. For this reason, players are constantly compared to their peers and to the legends of the past in order to answer the most hotly contested question of the sport:  </p> <h2 id = "question" class = "slide-2-question"> "Who is the greatest of all time?" </h2>

		 <p id = "rex" class = "s3-text"> Sports journalist John Sapochetti presents his take on the topic at hand in his Full Press Coverage article “Lebron, not Michael is the Greatest of All Time.” In it, he addresses Lebron’s case for the title of “the G.O.A.T” by making a comparison to Michael Jordan. He argues that Lebron is the superior offensive force due to an increased impact on the game, referencing his efficiency, by virtue of his career field-goal percentage -- 50.4%, beating out Jordan's by a margin of .7% (49.7%) -- and career rebounding and assist averages, which he uses to imply that Lebron creates more opportunities for his teammates -- through his assists - and ultimately secures more possessions and potential scoring opportunities  -- through his increased rebounding averages. Following this, Sapochetti acknowledges that although Jordan’s perfect 6-0 record when compared to that of Lebron’s 4-6, is “tough to argue against,” Lebron should not be punished for “dragging several overmatched teams to the Finals.” He goes as far as to follow his assertion up with the statement that “Jordan played very good, not great teams [during] his [trips] to the Finals.” Sapochetti elaborates on this claim by drawing a comparison, listing both Lebron and Jordan’s NBA Finals competition which includes players such as Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Tim Duncan: ultimately concluding that Lebron played “vastly superior” competition when compared to Jordan. Sapochetti concludes the article by offering readers to consider that basketball is a team sport. Therefore, he believes that despite Jordan holding an advantage in the number of championships he possesses, it is not the determining factor in who the better player between the two is: especially in the absence of context. </p>

		 <p id = "revolution" class = "s4-text"> In sports journalist, Neil Paine’s FiveThirtyEight article titled “Why Michael Jordan Was The Best,” Paine asserts that Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time due to his endured statistical dominance. Paine alludes to metrics such as “Win Shares per 48 minutes” and “Player Efficiency Rating” –- which in both cases, Jordan leads – to provide examples of data that solidify Jordan’s ranking at number one amongst the greatest players of all time. According to Paine, Jordan’s “reputation as the GOAT was not merely a media creation or the product of ring-counting – it has withstood the tests of both time and science.” Utilizing RAPTOR, a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to a team’s offense and defense per 100 possessions, the data shows that, yet again, Jordan is the modern leader in this category. Following this, Paine seeks to prove that “MJ pushed the boundaries of efficient [play,]” showing that Jordan is an outlier on the usage-vs.-efficiency curve for all-time players. In addition to this, Paine includes the fact that Jordan is one of “two [] players in NBA history [who have] had a career usage rate of at least 30 percent with a turnover percentage under 10 percent.” Paine further elaborates on this statistic, implying it only strengthens Jordan’s case as the “G.O.A.T,” especially considering it was done in an offense which “led the league in scoring 10 times” and in which Jordan contributed to nearly “25% percent of [his] teammate[‘s] baskets.” Ultimately, Paine concludes his argument by acknowledging those critical of his stance on the subject by addressing that although it is believed that Jordan played in a “diluted era” with a “strong supporting cast,” Jordan excelled in a time in which the league was far more physically demanding, and he offers those reading to consider Jordan's profound influence on the game as a whole. </p>

			<!-- <a href = "https://fullpresscoverage.com/2020/02/27/lebron-not-michael-is-the-greatest-of-all-time/"> “Lebron, not Michael is the Greatest of All Time,” </a> frames the problem at stake by placing an increased emphasis on a comparison between both Michael Jordan and Lebron James. The article itself appears to be John Sapochetti’s attempt at changing the public’s perception, who by vast majority, seem to agree that Jordan is “the G.O.A.T.” Therefore, it can be inferred that the article’s purpose is to persuade readers, which we can assume are basketball fans or follow the sport to some degree, into buying in to the narrative that Lebron James is the greatest player to have ever played the sport. The platform that Sapochetti chooses to voice his message on has an influence on the liberty that he is given to make his case. Due to the fact that the publication of the article was made on the website of a relatively small digital media company (<a href = "https://fullpresscoverage.com/">fullpresscoverage.com</a>), the way in which he chooses to expresses himself takes on a more casual form. In addition to this, the genre of the article itself warrants a more easy-going approach due to the nature of the world of sports. Although he explicitly states the reasoning behind limiting his comparison down to just two players, Michael Jordan and Lebron James, the deliberate omission of other players equally worthy of the title limits the scope of influence of the argument. If we don’t consider all of the possible candidates for the title, how can we be certain the one that we have come to embrace as the “greatest” is truly the best? Personally, I believe in order to have provided a more wholistic argument, he should’ve made the comparison between all of players who qualify for the title both statistically, and in the eyes of the basketball community. It is understood that his target is to persuade the majority of people, more specifically, those who believe Jordan is the greatest of all time, but to those who believe other-wise, in that maybe they believe that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or perhaps Larry Bird is the greatest, that should’ve been considered: and a more thorough argument should have been constructed. However, the angle of vision we are presented with suffices in making the distinction between both Jordan and Lebron. The logical progression and development of the text is sound. Sapochetti structures his argument by choosing to focus on generalities. Amongst these, are the narratives that revolve around both Jordan and Lebron that Sapochetti views as threats to Lebron’s ascension in the so-called “G.O.A.T” hierarchy. Nonetheless, the fact that Sapochetti chose to address such broad concepts such as offensive averages, and the lack of championships that Lebron has been able to win and why, limits the argument, as although this allows for us to get an overview of the two players, it serves as more of a preface to the argument. Without the use of advanced metrics, it shows that Sapochetti fails to demonstrate an understanding of the nuances that accompany the argument. This lack of depth goes on to affect the reader’s perception of his basketball knowledge by virtue of the fact that it makes it seem as though he shares the insight of a casual fan. Not to mention, the way in which Sapochetti chooses to develop his points and arguments such as when describing Jordan’s competition comes off as immature and unjust as it doesn’t properly credit Jordan for his accomplishments. Following this, Sapochetti’s appeal to readers’ emotions, imaginations, and values is weak and underdeveloped. The exclusion of Lebron’s backstory coupled with the absence of Lebron’s most inspiring and iconic moments weakens the article’s impact. In addition, Sapochetti’s weak use of broad statistics and the injection of bias debilitate his appeal to logic and make it difficult for readers to make an informed opinion. Ultimately, I both disagree and agree with the values of the author, I appreciate Lebron’s contribution to the sport, but I can’t get myself to support the author’s indifference towards Jordan’s accomplishments.  </p>
			<p class = "jordan-sum"> Neil Paine, author of “Why Michael Jordan Was The Best” expresses his concerns for the debate on who the greatest basketball player of all time is. The piece itself was written on behalf of all sports fans, but is more clearly catered to those who are fans of basketball. Paine’s purpose in writing the article is to persuade readers that Michael Jordan was and is the greatest basketball player of all time due to his endured statistical dominance and lasting impact on the sport. The article was published to the FiveThirtyEight website, fivethirtyeight.com, which is owned by ABC News. As a direct result of this, it appears as though Paine deviates from what the genre of sports usually encourages, which often times is a less analytical approach than the one presented in the article. This orderly approach however, improves the quality of the text and allows for Paine to delve deeper into the subject, enrichening the readers’ experience and knowledge of the topic at hand. Paine’s approach to answering the question of who the “G.O.A.T” is centers mainly around using data and statistical analysis to drive his points forward. Consequently, the text’s logical development is extensive and consistent. Paine highlights far more than simple metrics such as points per game, field-goal percentage, and so on, which often fail to provide the context needed to properly reach a conclusion. Instead, he opts for metrics such Win Shares per 48 minutes, Player Efficiency Rating, Game Scores, but most surprisingly he includes the use of an original metric called RAPTOR or Robust Algorithm using Player Tracking and On/Off Ratings. This falls perfectly in line with Paine’s claim that “[Jordan] has the stats on his side[.]” Paine comes across as fair, reliable, and knowledgeable on the subject. It is apparent through his diction in the text that he understands the complexity of the issue -- “Was Jordan actually the greatest ever? It’s something of a loaded question.” Not to mention, he acknowledges that there are people that disagree with him, and he uses this to further push his argument by asking readers to consider Jordan’s elaborate lore and the deep influence on those who came after him. Therefore, he makes a stronger argument by relating to those who oppose his views by getting them to rationalize with him. In relation to his ability to knowledgably articulate his points, his diction and ample use of facts lead me to believe that he is well-informed and can be trusted on the subject. As for his ability to relate the readers’ emotions, he falls short by failing to include details regarding some of Jordan’s triumphs and successes that could aid in swaying public opinion by failing to provide examples and by assuming that the reader has already seen the emotionally charged Netflix documentary on Michael Jordan himself “The Last Dance.” Paine does attempt to make an appeal to values by reasoning with whoever may disagree with his stance in order to reach a broader audience: “So the arguments can go in both directions. But the numbers tell us that Jordan was uniquely great, both in terms of what he did and how he did it[]” is an example of this. Ultimately, Paine provides a thorough and well-supported argument for why he believes that Michael Jordan is the best of all time. However, in doing so, he fails to address some of the intangible components of a player which may give them a slight advantage. Furthermore, with Paine trying to make his case as to why Michael Jordan is the greatest of all time using statistics, the same argument could be made for a slew of other great players with the use of different metrics. Although statistics can be helpful in determining who the greatest of all time is, it can be a flawed means of gauging who the best truly is. There are a variety of other factors that contribute to a player’s legacy and overall skill, so Paine’s oversight of this simple fact hurts his argument. --> </p>

		<p class = "simdif">  Paine and Sapochetti’s articles differ most starkly in the manner in which they are composed. Paine chooses to make a far stronger appeal to reason, with data and analytics being the driving force behind his argument. Sapochetti on the other hand, relies more heavily on comparison as a means to justify his stance on why believes Lebron is the greater player when compared to Jordan.  The scale of influence of where the articles themselves are published proves to have a subtle, yet noticeable effect on the authors’ tones in their writing. 
		For example, the website in which Sapochetti’s article is published, which is smaller in scale when compared to Paine’s, gives him more freedom to inject his personality into his writing by making use of sarcasm and more casual forms of syntax. As for the two articles’ similarities, both fail to make a solid appeal to emotions. Additionally, they share the common goal of persuading readers and acknowledge and address the ideals of the opposing side of the argument to strengthen their own.  </p>

		<p class = "synthesis"> Although both authors make strong cases for who they believe is the greatest of all time, I have come to the conclusion that the “G.O.A.T.” argument is far too convoluted to reach a definite answer. The nature of sports incentivizes comparison, so it is understood why the conversation holds the weight that it does amongst basketball fans; however, I offer readers to consider the variety of factors that are often times ignored when making the case for a certain player as well as the implications the argument holds and its effects on the sport as a whole. For one, we must ask ourselves what it means for a player to be the “greatest.” Ultimately, who we regard as the best is a reflection of what we value in a player. For some, the greatest of all time is Bill Russell which Sapochetti goes as far to acknowledge as “the greatest winner in team sports history.” Consider Wilt Chamberlain for example, who was so dominant for his time that he produced news articles with headlines like “Can Basketball Survive Chamberlain?” Each of the players that have a stake amongst those deemed worthy of the title made unique contributions to the game of basketball and although they may differ slightly in personal accomplishments, they all share a relatively similar degree of success: hence why they are in the conversation in the first place. To try and answer the question as accurately as possible we must delve into the logistics of the question itself. How can we objectively determine who the undisputed greatest of all-time is? Is there a certain metric that we can use to measure a player’s greatness? No, the truth of the matter is that you can’t. The argument itself is based in large part on opinion, therefore, much of the issue comes in large part from a need to justify our own personal thought on the matter. In doing so, we often tend to devalue or ignore the accomplishments of others which has grave effects on our understanding and appreciation of basketball and its lore. Both articles tackle this concept in their own distinct way. In Paine’s article he chooses to omit any of the accolades, anecdotes, or advanced metrics used for Jordan’s case that would have aided other great players’ case for the title (for obvious reasons). What this implies though, is that the introduction of other great players’ career accomplishments dilutes Paine’s argument, which is a logical conclusion to draw. If he were to delve deeper into the statistics of players such as Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, etc. in the manner that he did Jordan then he would be forced to compare why said players statistics and accolades hold more weight when compared to another’s. This very paradox in and of itself ruins the very objectivity that Paine sought to achieve through his analytical oriented approach to the argument. As for Sapochetti, his indifference towards Jordan’s competition and career accomplishments, devalues not only his argument, but his appreciation of the sport as well. When you choose to insist that Jordan played “very good, not great teams,” a topic also briefly addressed by Paine, you fail to acknowledge Jordan’s accomplishments for his era which devalues the experience that comes with learning about the history of basketball. I understand that Sapochetti’s account of Jordan’s competition is a device to push his argument, but then again, that is the very reason that the argument itself is harmful to the sport. While on the topic of competition, we must confront one glaring factor that is often neglected. When we compare players, we often make comparisons amongst players that played across different eras. When we do this, we fail to realize that the game of basketball is continuously evolving. Throughout eras players have had to face far different conditions. For example, up until the fall of 2003, hand-checking or the “illegal contact by a defensive player which impedes the forward and/or lateral movement of the offensive player” as it is formally known, was permitted. Centers were allowed to stay in the paint for extended periods of time, making it increasingly difficult to score. That was until 2001, when the defensive three second rule was implemented in an effort to combat this. The NBA hadn’t even adopted the 3-point line until Magic Johnson and 
Larry Bird’s rookie year in 1979. In addition to this, it took almost 35 for the league to fully embrace the change and begin to truly utilize the three point-line’s implementation with the rise of Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors. How could we possibly compare players amongst different eras when the set of rules they followed were completely different? For a brief stint, 9 years to be exact, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor at the time, influenced a rule that banned dunking which led to the unique adoption of his patented move: the skyhook. How would “Air” Jordan ever take flight in such conditions? Growing up, all of these players, as a consequence of the era of basketball in which they were born into, all developed distinct styles unique to their time. This very concept is addressed by Paine when speaking about Jordan’s placement on the “usage-vs.-efficiency curve” stating “Jordan’s placement is even more impressive when you consider that he didn’t make much use of the 3-point shot.” He acknowledges that Jordan’s prolific scoring occurred in the absence of a dependency on a three-point shot; implying that Jordan could have been even more deadly had he developed this area of his game. With this comes the notion that the argument is not only rooted in opinion but in speculation as well, which makes the argument all the more trivial. Had some of the great players of the past played in today’s game would they still be as impactful? We can’t be sure. This goes to show the abstraction that accompanies the argument as a whole. Ultimately, the debate itself is too difficult, complex and holds far too many implications to be truthfully and directly answered. </p> -->
